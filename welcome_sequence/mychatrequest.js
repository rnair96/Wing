const chatText = `Hey, I'm Raj and I'm the Founder & CEO of Wing.

Fun fact, I was a former Dating Coach that helped men find partners they aligned with based on Mission & Values. 
Sound familiar? 

Here's the simple 3 steps to meet a Wing here:

1. Break the ice with a chat request. A joke or a compliment about something on their profile helps.
2. Figure out if you’re a good fit and can help each other for your goals. 
3. Decide a place and time to meet, then hit the town!

Tip: If you’re struggling with deciding on a place, check out our latest promotions of establishments near you and try one out with your Wing.

First, I want to say I truly appreciate that you're here right now. 
You could be on any other app in the world, but you're on this one.
That matters to me.

That's why I'm reaching out to connect with you as I'd love to personally get to know you and how we can improve your experience here. 

This is a young community, so every opinion has a significant role to determine how this community can grow!

If having a chance to connect and shape this community interests you, then simply reply "Yes!" to this Chat Request.

P.S if you reply, I’ll drop the method me and my Wings used to successfully approach girls in any situation ;)`
