const missionText = `Our Mission

The mission of Wing is to help solve one of the biggest problems in modern society,
men's loneliness.

The reasons are numerous but we'll outline a few:
- Men are more stoic and don't make new friends as often as women
- Many men suffer from a lack of purpose and access to meaningful community
- Most men rely on dating apps to find someone, which absolutely SUCK for the average guy.

That's why Wing isn't a dating app, it's a networking app designed to help with dating, as well as all the other realms of a man's life
including fitness and passions.

It is an opportunity for men to discover a mission, build a meaningful community, and always have a Wingman ready to go out with
so they NEVER have to rely on a dating app again.`
